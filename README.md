# Image-Enhancement-in-Spatial-Domain
The purpose of this project is to work with the fundamental spatial domain image enhancement techniques. The project is organized in three parts each of which requires different techniques. For each part, developing different algorithm based on the techniques and tune them for specific images.

# Part-1
Decode the encoded text in the image

# Part-2
Enhance the quality of image by removing the noise

# Part-3
Enhance the quality of image by removing the blur
